# En la RaspBerry siempre
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install realvnc-vnc-server realvnc-vnc-viewer

# Then enable VNC in configuration
sudo raspi-config (To set VNS Enable)
In headless mode you may want to improve RPI desktop configuration by touching /boot/config.txt

# HOW TO CONNECT WITH VNC VIEWER
# In your RPI estar server (could ask for a password as VNC uses encryption)
vncserver :1
vncserver -kill :<display-number>

# In your mac start viwer
setup your viers like: 192.168.1.XXX:1


# CHANGE AUTHETIFICATION OF VNC SERVER
If you are in front of your Raspberry Pi and can see its screen, 
  open the VNC Server dialog on your Raspberry Pi, 
  select Menu > Options > Security, and choose VNC password from the Authentication dropdown.

if you're configuring your Raspberry Pi remotely from the command line,
  then to make the changes for Service Mode (the default configuration for the Raspberry Pi):
  Open the /root/.vnc/config.d/vncserver-x11 config file.
  Replace Authentication=SystemAuth with Authentication=VncAuth and save the file.
  In the command line, run sudo vncpasswd -service. 
  This will prompt you to set a password, and will insert it for you in the right config file for VNC Server running in Service Mode.
  Restart VNC Server.

# DIRECT RPI TO VNC (Experimental Feature)
Remotely access apps which use a directly rendered overlay, such as Minecraft, the text console,Pi Camera Module, and more.

To turn this feature on:
    On your Raspberry Pi, open the VNC Server dialog.
    Navigate to Menu > Options > Troubleshooting and select Enable experimental direct capture mode.
